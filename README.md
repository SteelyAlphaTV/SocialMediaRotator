# OBS Social Media Rotator
A simple image rotator using vanilla JavaScript that can be used to rotate through social media information for streams or whatever else! 

Simply replace the existing file paths to the paths for the images you want to rotate through, and then just add the HTML file as a browser source in OBS!
